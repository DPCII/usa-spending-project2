# USA Spending Assistant API

This API delivers detailed data about the spending within the Federal Agencies of the US Government. It's purpose is simply to make relevant data more approachable to consumers by simplifying and organizing what is a vast landscape of endpoints. The data is sourced from the government resource at api.usaspending.gov. 

## Technologies Used

This is a Node.js backend complimented by Express, Cors, Body Parser, Axios, and Mongoose connected to a MongoDB database. The MongoDB database is deployed through Atlas and the server is deployed on Heroku.

## What's Next

1. Building out a front end to both ease accessibility and enable dynamic data retrieval 
2. Completing the dynamic architecture
3. Potentially incorporating data visualization components and further data associations (perhaps by fiscal year) to increase utility
